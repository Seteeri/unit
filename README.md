unit
====

The definition of a "unit":

	"an individual thing or person regarded as single and complete but which can also form an individual component of a larger or more complex whole."

As such, this library contains single functions that don't require additional
functions beyond the standard pico namespace - "one-off" functions so to speak.

They are all contained in the namespace 'unit and are meant to be imported
directly into a project namespace (using import).
